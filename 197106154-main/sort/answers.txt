sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: well on nearly sorted data but was significantly slower on reversed data, characteristic of bubble sort.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: efficiently on all datasets, including reversed and random, aligning with O(n log n) complexity of merge sort.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: slow on all datasets, indicating an O(n^2) sorting complexity typical of selection sort.
